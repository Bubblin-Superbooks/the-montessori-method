As when we wish to perfect the language we first start children at composition and then pass to grammatical study; and when we wish to perfect the style we first teach to write grammatically and then come to the analysis of styleâ€”so when we wish to perfect the <em>speech</em> it is first necessary that the speech <em>exist</em>, and then it is proper to proceed to its analysis. When, therefore, the child <em>speaks</em>, but before the completion of the development of speech which renders it fixed in mechanisms already established, the speech should be analysed with a view to perfecting it.</p><p>Now, as grammar and rhetoric are not possible with the spoken language but demand recourse to the written language which keeps ever before the eye the discourse to be analysed, so it is with speech.</p><p>The analysis of the transient is impossible.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The language must be materialised and made stable.</p></div> </div>
