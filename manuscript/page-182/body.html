This is the second "Children's House" which has been established within the ill-favoured Quarter of San Lorenzo.</p><p>The Quarter of San Lorenzo is celebrated, for every newspaper in the city is filled with almost daily accounts of its wretched happenings.

And indeed San Lorenzo is not the <em>People's</em> Quarter, it is the Quarter of the <em>poor</em>. It is the Quarter where lives the underpaid, often unemployed workingman, a common type in a city which has no factory industries. It is the home of him who undergoes the period of surveillance to which he is condemned after his prison sentence is ended. They are all here, mingled, huddled together.</p></div> </div>
