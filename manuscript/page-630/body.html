When, however, the child's speech is sufficiently developed, and when he <em>pronounces all the sounds</em>, it does not matter which of the letters we select in our lessons.</p><p>Many of the defects which have become permanent in  adults are due to <em>functional errors in the development</em> of the language during the period of infancy. If, for the attention which we pay to the correction of linguistic defects in children in the upper grades, we would substitute <em>a direction of the development of the language</em> while the child is still young, our results would be much more practical and valuable. In fact, many of the defects in pronunciation arise from the use of a <em>dialect</em>, and these it is almost impossible to correct after the period of childhood. They may, however, be most easily removed through the use of educational methods especially adapted to the perfecting of the language in little children.</p></div> </div>
