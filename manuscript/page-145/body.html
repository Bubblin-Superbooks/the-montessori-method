<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>To put it broadly, it is important to define <em>the method</em>, <em>the technique</em>, and from its application to <em>await</em> the definite result, which must be gathered entirely from actual experience. One of the characteristics of experimental sciences is to proceed to the making of an experiment <em>without preconceptions of any sort</em> as to the final result of the experiment itself. For example, should we wish to make scientific observations concerning the development of the head as related to varying degrees of intelligence, one of the conditions of such an experiment would be to ignore, in the taking of the measurements, which were the most intelligent and which the most backward among the scholars examined. And this because the preconceived idea that the most intelligent should have the head more fully developed will inevitably alter the results of the research.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He who experiments must, while doing so, divest</p></div> </div>
