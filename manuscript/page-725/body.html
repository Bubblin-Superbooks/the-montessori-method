<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">enough. It is necessary to make the child <em>feel</em> what we mean by <em>nothing</em>. To this end we make use of little games which vastly entertain the children. I stand among them, and turning to one of them who has already used this material, I say, "Come, dear, come to me <em>zero</em> times." The child almost always comes to me, and then runs back to his place. "But, my boy, you came <em>one</em> time, and I told you to come <em>zero</em> times." Then he begins to wonder. "But what must I do, then?" "Nothing; zero is nothing." "But how shall I do nothing?" "Don't do anything. You must sit still. You must not come at all, not any times. Zero times. No times at all." I repeat these exercises until the children understand, and they are then, immensely amused at remaining quiet when I call to them to come to me zero times, or to throw me zero kisses.  They themselves often cry out, "Zero is nothing! Zero is nothing!"</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
