<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">stars? No! Look at my apron. Do you know what colour it is? Doesn't it seem to you the same colour as the sky? Very well then, look at this colour I have in my hand. It is the same colour as the sky and my apron. It is <em>blue</em>. Now look around you a little and see if you can find something in the room which is blue. And do you know what colour cherries are, and the colour of the burning coals in the fireplace, etc., etc."</p><p>Now in the mind of the child after he has made the useless effort of trying to guess there revolves a confused mass of ideas,â€”the sky, the apron, the cherries, etc. It will be difficult for him to extract from all this confusion the  idea which it was the scope of the lesson to make clear to him; namely, the recognition of the two colours, blue and red. Such a work of selection is almost impossible for the mind of a child who is not yet able to follow a long discourse.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I remember being present at an arithmetic lesson</p></div> </div>
