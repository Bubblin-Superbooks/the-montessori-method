They do for the colour sense what <em>free design</em> does for the sense of <em>form</em>. In other words, they reveal the capacity of the child <em>in the matter of observation of colours</em>, as the free design showed us the extent to which he was an observer of form in the objects surrounding him. I shall speak more fully of this work in the chapter on <em>writing</em>. The exercises consist in filling in with coloured pencil, certain outlines drawn in black. These outlines present the simple geometric figures and various objects with which the child is familiar in the schoolroom, the home, and the garden. The child must <em>select</em> his colour, and in doing so he shows us whether he has observed the colours of the things surrounding him.</p></div> </div>
