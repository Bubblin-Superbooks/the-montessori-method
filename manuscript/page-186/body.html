<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">paragraph, this little detail of the mass of misery.</p><p>Whoever enters, for the first time, one of these apartments is astonished and horrified. For this spectacle of genuine misery is not at all like the garish scene he has imagined. We enter here a world of shadows, and that which strikes us first is the darkness which, even though it be midday, makes it impossible to distinguish any of the details of the room.</p><p>When the eye has grown accustomed to the gloom, we perceive, within, the outlines of a bed upon which lies huddled a figureâ€”someone ill and suffering. If we have come to bring money from some society for mutual aid, a candle must be lighted before the sum can be counted and the receipt signed. Oh, when we talk of social problems, how often we speak vaguely, drawing upon our fancy for details instead of preparing ourselves to judge intelligently through a personal investigation of facts and conditions.</p></div> </div>
