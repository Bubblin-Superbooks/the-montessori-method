<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">shaking the boxes.</p><p>In the lessons for the sense of hearing I proceed as follows: I have the teachers establish silence in the usual way and then I <em>continue</em> the work, making the silence more profound. I say, "St! St!" in a series of modulations, now sharp and short, now prolonged and light as a whisper. The children, little by little, become fascinated by this. Occasionally I say, "More silent stillâ€”more silent."</p><p>I then begin the sibilant St! St! again, making it always lighter and repeating "More silent still," in a barely audible voice. Then I say still in a low whisper, "Now, I hear the clock, now I can hear the buzzing of a fly's wings, now I can hear the whisper of the trees in the garden."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The children, ecstatic with joy, sit in such absolute and complete silence that the room seems deserted; then I whisper, "Let us close our eyes."
