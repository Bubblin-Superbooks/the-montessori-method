<em>ALICE HALLGARTEN</em>
<em>of New York, who by her marriage to Baron Leopold Franchetti became by choice our compatriot.</em>
<em>Ever a firm believer in the principles underlying the Case dei Bambini, she, with her husband, forwarded the publication of this book in Italy, and, throughout the last years of her short life, greatly desired the English translation which should introduce to the land of her birth the work so near her heart.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>To her memory I dedicate this book, whose pages, like an ever-living flower, perpetuate the recollection of her beneficence.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
