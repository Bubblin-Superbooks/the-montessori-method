<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">The eye of the child here corresponds to the frame, which <em>materially</em> led him at first to bring the two pieces together. In addition to covering the figure, the child is to accustom himself to <em>touching</em> the contour of the mounted figures as a part of the exercise (the child always voluntarily follows those movements); and after he has placed the wooden inset he again touches the contour, adjusting with his finger the superimposed piece until it exactly covers the form beneath.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Second Series.</em> We give a number of cards to the child together with the corresponding wooden insets. In this second series, the figures are repeated by an outline of blue paper. The child through these exercises is passing gradually from the <em>concrete</em> to the <em>abstract</em>. At first, he handled only <em>solid objects</em>. He then passed to a <em>plane figure</em>, that is, to the plane which in itself does not exist.  He is now passing to the <em>line</em>, but this line does not represent for him the abstract contour of a plane figure.</p></div> </div>
