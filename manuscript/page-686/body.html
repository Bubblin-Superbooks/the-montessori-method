<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">content? Reading aloud is one of the most difficult intellectual actions. The child, therefore, who <em>begins</em> to read by interpreting thought <em>should read mentally</em>. The written language must isolate itself from the articulate, when it rises to the interpretation of logical thought. Indeed, it represents the language which <em>transmits thought at a distance</em>, while the senses and the muscular mechanism are silent. It is a spiritualised language, which puts into communication all men who know how to read.</p><p>Education having reached such a point in the "Children's Houses," the entire elementary school must, as a logical consequence, be changed. How to reform the lower grades in the elementary schools, eventually carrying  them on according to our methods, is a great question which cannot be discussed here. I can only say that the <em>first elementary</em> would be completely done away with by our infant education, which includes it.</p></div> </div>
