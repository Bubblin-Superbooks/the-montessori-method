It would be well that the child, by exercising the motor channels of articulate language should establish exactly the movements necessary to a perfect articulation, <em>before</em> the age of easy motor adaptations is passed, and, by the fixation of erroneous mechanisms, the defects become incorrigible.</p></div> </div>
