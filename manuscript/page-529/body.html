There will be children who, after having touched a few times the stuffs, or merely the smooth and rough cards, <em>will quite spontaneously touch the various surfaces about them</em>, repeating "Smooth! Rough! It is velvet! etc." In dealing with normal children, we must <em>await</em> this spontaneous investigation of the surroundings, or, as I like to call it, this <em>voluntary explosion</em> of the exploring spirit. In such cases, the children experience a joy at each <em>fresh discovery</em>. They are conscious of a sense of dignity and satisfaction which encourages them to seek for new sensations from their environment and to make themselves spontaneous <em>observers</em>.</p></div> </div>
