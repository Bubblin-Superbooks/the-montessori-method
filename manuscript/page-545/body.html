She should begin with two strongly-contrasted forms, as the square and the circle, and should follow the usual method, using the three periods of SÃ©guin. We do not teach all the names relative to the geometric figures, giving only those of the most familiar forms, such as square, circle, rectangle, triangle, oval. We now call attention to the fact that there are <em>rectangles which are narrow and long</em>, and others which are <em>broad and short</em>, while the <em>squares</em> are equal on all sides and can be only big and little. These things are most easily shown with the insets, for, though we turn the square about, it still enters its frame, while the rectangle, if placed across the opening, will not enter.</p></div> </div>
