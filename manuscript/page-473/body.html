The figure can only enter the corresponding frame. This makes it possible for the child to work by himself, and to accomplish a genuine sensory auto-education, in the visual perception of form.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Exercise with the three series of cards. First series.</em> We give the child the wooden forms and the cards upon which the white figure is mounted. Then we mix the cards upon the table; the child must arrange them in a line upon his table (which he loves to do), and then place the corresponding wooden pieces upon the cards. Here the control lies in the eyes. The child must <em>recognise</em> this figure, and place the wooden piece upon it so perfectly that it will cover and hide the paper figure.</p></div> </div>
