I have the child touch the contour of the piece with the <em>index finger</em> of <em>his right hand</em>, and then have him repeat this with the contour of the frame into which the pieces must fit. We succeed in making this a <em>habit</em> with the child. This is very easily attained, since all children love to <em>touch</em> things. I have already learned, through my work with deficient children, that among the various forms of sense memory that of the muscular sense is the most precocious. Indeed, many children who have not arrived at the point of recognising a <em>figure by looking at it</em>, could recognise it by <em>touching it</em>, that is, by computing the movements necessary to the following of its contour. The same is true of the greater number of normal children;â€”confused as to where to place a figure, they turn it about trying in vain to fit it in, yet as soon as they have touched the two contours of the piece and its frame, they succeed in placing it perfectly. </p></div> </div>
