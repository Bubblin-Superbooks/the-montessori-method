<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">drawer contains six curved figures (an ellipse, an oval, etc., and a flower-like figure formed by four crossed arcs).</p><p><em>Exercise with the Insets.</em> This exercise consists in presenting to the child the large frame or tray in which we may arrange the figures as we wish to present them. We proceed to take out the insets, mix them upon the table, and then invite the child to put them back in place. This game may be played by even the younger children and holds the attention for a long period, though not for so long a time as the exercise with the cylinders. Indeed, I have never seen a child repeat this exercise more than five or six times. The child, in fact, expends much energy upon this exercise. He must <em>recognise</em> the form and must look at it carefully.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">At first many of the children only succeed in placing the insets after many attempts, trying for example to place a triangle in a trapezoid, then in a rectangle, etc.</p></div> </div>
