<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Quarter of San Lorenzo. The plan followed in this transformation is as follows:</p><p>A: To demolish in every building all portions of the structure not originally constructed with the idea of making homes, but, from a purely commercial standpoint, of making the rental roll larger. In other words, the new management tore down those parts of the building which encumbered the central court, thus doing away with dark, ill-ventilated apartments, and giving air and light to the remaining portion of the tenement. Broad airy courts take the place of the inadequate air and light shafts, rendering the remaining apartments more valuable and infinitely more desirable.</p><p>B: To increase the number of stairways, and to divide the room space in a more practical way. The large six or seven room suites are reduced to small apartments of one, two, or three rooms, and a kitchen.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The importance of such changes may be recognised</p></div> </div>
