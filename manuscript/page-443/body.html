It must be made a necessary phase of <em>education</em> because it prepares for a life in which man exercises and uses the tactile sense through the medium of these finger tips. Hence, I have the child wash his hands carefully with soap, in a little basin; and in another basin I have him rinse them in a bath of tepid water. Then I show him how to dry and rub his hands gently, in this way preparing for the regular bath. I next teach the child how to <em>touch</em>, that is, the manner in which he should touch surfaces. For this it is necessary to take  the finger of the child and to draw <em>it very, very lightly</em> over the surface.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Another particular of the technique is to teach the child to hold his eyes closed while he touches,</p></div> </div>
