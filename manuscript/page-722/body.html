Having mixed the rods upon a carpet, the directress selects one, and showing it to the child, has him count the sections; for example, 5. She then asks him to give her the one next in length. He selects it <em>by his eye</em>, and the directress has him <em>verify</em> his choice by <em>placing the two pieces side by side and by counting their sections</em>. Such exercises may be repeated in great variety and through them the child learns to assign a <em>particular name to each one of the pieces in the long stair</em>. We may now call them piece number one; piece number two, etc., and finally, for brevity, may speak of them in the lessons as one, two, three, etc.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
