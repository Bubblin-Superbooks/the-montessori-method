But the <em>observation of the form</em> cannot be too advanced for a child at this age. The plane of the table at which the child sits while eating his supper is probably a rectangle; the plate which contains his food is a circle, and we certainly do not consider that the child is too <em>immature</em> to be allowed to look at the table and the plate.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The insets which we present simply call the attention to a given <em>form</em>. As to the name, it is analogous to other names by which the child learns to call things. Why should we consider it premature to teach the child the words <em>circle</em>, <em>square</em>, <em>oval</em>, when in his home he repeatedly hears the word <em>round</em> used in connection with plates, etc. He will hear his parents speak of the <em>square</em> table, the <em>oval</em> table, etc., and these words in common use will  remain for a long time</p></div> </div>
