The day may come when the tenant, having given to the proprietor of the house a certain sum, shall receive in exchange whatever is necessary to the <em>comfort</em> of life; in other words, the administration shall become the <em>steward</em> of the family.</p><p>The house, thus considered, tends to assume in its evolution a significance more exalted than even the English word "home" expresses. It does not consist of walls alone, though these walls be the pure and shining guardians of that intimacy which is the sacred symbol of the family. The home shall become more than this. It lives! It has a soul. It may be said to embrace its inmates with the  tender, consoling arms of woman. It is the giver of moral life, of blessings; it cares for, it educates and feeds the little ones. Within it, the tired workman shall find rest and newness of life. He shall find there the intimate life of the family, and its happiness.</p></div> </div>
