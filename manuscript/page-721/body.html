We then have him name the single rods from the shortest to the longest, according to the total number of the sections which each contains, touching the rods at the sides  B, on which side the stair ascends. This results in the same numeration as when we counted the longest rodâ€”1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Wishing to know the number of rods, we count them from the side A and the same numeration results; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This correspondence of the three sides of the triangle causes the child to verify his</p></div> </div>
